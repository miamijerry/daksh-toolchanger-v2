Made a number of changes to the original Carriage ( Uses pins to secure the belts)
* Carriage warps when printed, added cut-away supports to maintain dimensions after the carriage cools.
* Interference between carriage and Toolbody connectors (aka MGN12's), added 1.5mm deep pockets to carriage.
* Carriage in Fusion measures 102.7mm tall and V2ool toolbody center section measures 104mm, Scaled carriage to 101% for printed dimension of 103.9
* Toolbody connectors (aka MGN12's) are too long and tool does not fully compress springs, Printed toolbody connectors with a 23mm and 23.5 centers with 693zz bearings.
* Pins that limit the sliders, are replaced by M3x40 screws, so the sliders can be replaced without removing or disassembling the Carriage.
* Jack screw holes added to Carriage, so the springs can be fully depress when adjusting / tightning the toolbody connectors to the V2ool body.
